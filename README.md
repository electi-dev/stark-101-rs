# Rust-STARK101

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the **STARK 101** protocol, originally designed and authored by the [StarkWare](https://starkware.co) team. The protocol is used to generate a STARK proof for the 1023rd element of the FibonacciSq sequence over a finite field.

## About

This educational project demonstrates how to create and verify STARK proofs in the Rust programming language. The STARK (**S**calable **T**ransparent **AR**gument of **K**nowledge) protocol is used to validate the calculation of a Fibonacci-Square sequence. Our goal is to facilitate a deeper understanding of STARK proofs and their applications in data integrity and blockchain technology.

The original tutorial, designed for Python, includes video lessons available [here](https://starkware.co/stark-101/). This Rust implementation aims to broaden the audience and application of STARK proofs.

## Getting Started

Refer to the original Python tutorial for a deep dive into the mathematical concepts behind the implementation. If you are new to Rust, we recommend going through the [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) to get started.
